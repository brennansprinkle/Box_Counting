# Box_Counting
Some codes to count particles in boxes and calculate statisitcs 

To run the code first compile the C++ module with `make`. Then modify the file `Fast_Box_Stats.py` for your specific example.
The MATLAB file `timescale_integral.m` processes the data computed using `Fast_Box_Stats.py` by computing the timescale integral.
